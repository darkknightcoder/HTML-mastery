        A superhero is a heroic stock character, typically possessing supernatural or superhuman powers,
       who is dedicated to fighting the evil of their universe, protecting the public, and battling super-villains.
       A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine, although the word superhero is also commonly used 
       for females. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially 
       in American comic book and films since the 1930s.</p>

      By most phenomena to be deemed superheroes: some (for example Batman) derive their status from the technology 
      they create and use.[1][2][3] While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in 
      a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] 
      the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or
      superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters
      , costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may
      not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.

      Some superheroes use their powers to help daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
      who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.

      Green Lantern, the Flash, Captain America, Thor, Wolverine, Iron Man and the X-Men have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>
